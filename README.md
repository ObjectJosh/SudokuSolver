Sudoku Solver
==================
This is another one of my personal projects. In this project, I use Python to code a Sudoku solver. The program uses recursion, backtracking to be specific, to find possible solutions for the puzzle. I hope you enjoy!

I decided to create a visualization of this process. However, due to GitHub Pages limitations, I could not code it in Python. However, I was able to code it in JavaScript. You may check it out here: https://objectjosh.github.io/SudokuSolveVisualizer/
