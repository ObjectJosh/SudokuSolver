Sudoku Solver
==================
This is another one of my personal projects. In this project, I use Python to code a Sudoku solver. The program uses recursion, backtracking to be specific, to find possible solutions for the puzzle. I hope you enjoy!

I plan to add an animation of the program solving the puzzle. Unfortunately, it is not possible to post onto GitHub pages because it is in Python.
